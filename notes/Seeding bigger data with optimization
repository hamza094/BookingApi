**** Seeding Big(ger) Data with Optimizations ****

To efficiently seed large amounts of data into a database, consider the following techniques:

- Create a separate seeder class specifically for testing large databases.

- When using factories to seed large data sets, be aware that it may take more time due to the increased volume.

- If accuracy is not a priority and you want to seed a significant amount of data, consider bypassing factories and directly populating the seeder file.

- Utilize bulk create or insert operations with an array chunk size of 500, and set the maximum and minimum ID values accordingly.

- Instead of storing 2000 items in an array, retain the array after every 500 data points to optimize memory usage.

By implementing these optimization techniques, you can effectively seed big(ger) data into your database.
